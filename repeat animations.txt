Steps to Loop Keyframes:
Select the Object:

Make sure the animated object (e.g., the "Armature") is selected.
Open the Graph Editor:

Switch to the Graph Editor view in the Blender workspace.
Select the Animation Data:

In the Graph Editor, ensure the specific animation curves (e.g., Location, Rotation, etc.) are visible and selected.
Add a Cyclic Modifier:

Press N to open the side panel in the Graph Editor (if it’s not already visible).
Expand the Modifiers tab.
Select one or more animation curves (e.g., Y Location) and click Add Modifier → Cycles.
Adjust Cycle Behavior:

The Cycles modifier will loop the animation indefinitely by default.
You can customize it:
Before: Repeat the animation before the first keyframe.
After: Repeat the animation after the last keyframe.
Play the Animation:

Your animation should now seamlessly loop.
